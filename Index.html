                    <p><em>Founder of not much but generally <strong>awesome guy.</strong></em>
                    <p>My name is Kent, I am a 37-year-old multi-talented individual with a diverse professional background. I have had a successful career as a fireman, and have also dedicated time to teaching at a special needs school. I was also part of the team that helped out at the London Olympics in 2012. In addition to these experiences, I have worked as a fire safety manager in the NHS. Currently, I am learning full-stack web development using the MERN stack and looking forward to expanding my skillset. In my free time, I am a skilled bass player and play in a function band. I also enjoy spending time with my two beloved cats, Smudge and Ella.</p>
